caluclator with html css and javascript

New Things Learned or Refreshed
I spent most my time starring at the screen.
I got my numbers to show up but I couldn't figure out how to do the math and make it show up.
I thought the easiest way was to use the eval() function but I read in the MDN documentation to never use eval(). 
So, I got stuck and lost patience.I remember doing a JavaScript calculator project about 5 months ago,
but it was clear today that that I must have just copied the solution as a code along as Brian Holt typed through it.
The code for my previous JavaScript Calculator project is NOTHING like the above code.I ended up watching John's solution and implemented his since I had already been at this problem for more than an hour. Word of caution, 
the solution above works to the extent that the user uses the calculator flawlessly. If not, there are many use case in which the code won't work and will throw errors. For example, if someone starts with an * operator instead of a number,the eval() function won't work. You'll get an Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token * at HTMLButtonElement. error.
